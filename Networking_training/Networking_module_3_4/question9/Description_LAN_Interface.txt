### Describe how you would configure a basic LAN interface using the ip command in Linux ###

The ip command is a versatile tool used to configure and manage networking on Linux systems. To configure a basic LAN interface using the ip command:



1. Display Current Network Interfaces

	Command: ip link show

	This command lists all the network interfaces on the system (e.g., eth0, enp3s0, etc.).



2. Bring the Interface Up

	Command: ip link set dev eth0 up

	This activates the eth0 interface.



3. Assign an IP Address to the Interface

	Command: ip addr add 192.168.1.16 dev eth0
	
	This command assigns the IP address 192.168.1.16 to the eth0 interface.



4. Verify Configuration

	Command: ip addr show eth0

	This will display the current configuration of the eth0 interface, including its IP address.



5. Bring the Interface Down

	Command: ip link set dev eth0 down
	
	This command shuts down the interface.
