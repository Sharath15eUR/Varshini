### IP Address Classification & NAT Explanation  

Step 1: Identify the Class of Each IP Address
 
	Each IP address belongs to a specific class based on the first octet (first number in the IP address).  

	- 192.168.10.5 → First octet is 192 → Class C (192-223)  
	- 172.20.15.1 → First octet is 172 → Class B (128-191)  
	- 8.8.8.8 → First octet is 8 → Class A (1-126)  

	Class A (1 - 126) is used for large networks (e.g., Internet providers, large companies).  
	Class B (128 - 191) is used for medium-sized networks (e.g., universities, government offices).  
	Class C (192 - 223) is used for small networks (e.g., home networks, small businesses).  


Step 2: Identify Private vs Public IPs
	Some IP address ranges are reserved as private and cannot be used on the internet.  

	Private IP ranges:  
	- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (Class A)  
	- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (Class B)  
	- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (Class C)  

	Checking the given IPs:  
	- 192.168.10.5 is private because it falls within 192.168.x.x.  
	- 172.20.15.1 is private because it falls within 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x.  
	- 8.8.8.8 is public because it is not in the private range (it is Google’s DNS server).  

	Private IPs are used for internal networks and cannot communicate directly on the internet.  
	Public IPs are assigned by ISPs and are routable on the internet.  


Step 3: How NAT Handles Private IPs on the Internet
	Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to convert private IPs into a public IP so devices can access the internet.  
	A router with NAT enabled replaces the private IP with a public IP when sending traffic to the internet.  

	How NAT Works Step-by-Step: 

		1. A PC with IP 192.168.1.10 wants to access Google (8.8.8.8).  
		2. The PC sends a request to 8.8.8.8.  
		3. The router receives the request and changes the source IP from 192.168.1.10 → 203.0.113.5 (public IP).  
		4. The request reaches Google’s server (8.8.8.8).  
		5. Google sends a response to 203.0.113.5 (public IP).  
		6. The router receives the reply and maps it back to 192.168.1.10 using NAT.  
		7. The PC receives the response from Google.  

	Types of NAT:
		- Static NAT: Maps one private IP to one public IP.  
		- Dynamic NAT: Uses a pool of public IPs to assign temporarily to internal devices.  
		- PAT (Port Address Translation): Multiple private IPs share one public IP using different ports (most common).
