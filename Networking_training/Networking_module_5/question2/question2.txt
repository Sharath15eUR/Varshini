ARP SPOOFING :

	ARP spoofing (also known as ARP poisoning) is an attack where an attacker sends false ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to a local network. The attacker can associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network (such as a router or another computer). This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or block network traffic between devices.


Steps:

	-In Packet Tracer, create a simple network with at least two or three PCS, a switch, and a router.

	-Assign static IPs

		-VICTIM
			IP ADDRESS : 192.168.1.2
			MAC ADDRESS : 0002.4A9E.14CD

		-PC
			IP ADDRESS : 192.168.1.3
			MAC ADDRESS : 0010.113D.4AA4

		-ATTACKER
			IP ADDRESS : 192.168.1.4
			MAC ADDRESS : 0005.5EC3.69EE
			
		-ROUTER
			IP ADDRESS : 192.168.1.1
			MAC ADDRESS : 0000.0CA0.E45A

	- Verify normal communication using ping and ARP table

		- ARP TABLE
			C:\>arp -a 
			Internet Address 	Physical Address 	Type 
			192.168.1.1 	 	0000.0ca0.e45a 		dynamic 
			192.168.1.3 		0010.113d.4aa4		dynamic 
			192.168.1.4 		0005.5ec3.69ee 		dynamic
 
	- Spoofed ARP table

		- ARP TABLE
			C:\>arp -a 
			Internet Address 	Physical Address 	Type 
			192.168.1.1 	 	0000.0ca0.e45a 		dynamic 
			192.168.1.3 		0005.5ec3.69ee		dynamic 
			192.168.1.4 		0005.5ec3.69ee 		dynamic

- Limitations

	- Packet Tracer is a simulation tool, not a real-time network, so certain dynamic attacks, like ARP spoofing, aren’t supported natively.

	- Cisco Packet Tracer doesn’t allow you to statically assign MAC addresses to IP addresses using the arp -s command.
