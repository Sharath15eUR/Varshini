Traceroute/Tracert :
Traceroute (or tracert in Windows) is a network diagnostic tool that traces the path of packets from your computer to a destination (such as a website). It shows each hop (router) along the way and measures the time taken for each hop.

Traceroute is particularly useful for identifying network latency, packet loss, or routing issues along the path from the source to the destination.


Example: TRACERT

C:\Users\DELL>tracert www.google.com

Tracing route to www.google.com [2404:6800:4007:820::2004]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

  1     1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  2409:4072:80d:5113::79
  2     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  3    84 ms    73 ms    72 ms  2405:200:363:168:c::2
  4    47 ms     *       61 ms  2405:200:801:900::1465
  5   441 ms   543 ms   744 ms  2405:200:801:900::12f8
  6    49 ms    49 ms    64 ms  2405:200:801:900::128f
  7    61 ms     *        *     2001:4860:1:1::d10
  8     *        *        *     Request timed out.
  9    50 ms    86 ms    72 ms  2404:6800:8135::1
 10     *        *        *     Request timed out.           



Parameters:

	- Hop Number:

		Each line represents a "hop," which refers to the routers or devices that your packets pass through on the way to the destination.
In the example above, Hop 1 is your local router, and Hop 10 is the final router in the Google network.
Round-Trip Time (RTT) for Each Probe:

		For each hop, the traceroute command sends three probes (packets). The output shows the round-trip times (RTT) for each probe, measured in milliseconds (ms).
		Example: For Hop 1, the RTT values are <1 ms for all three probes, indicating a very quick response time.


	- IP Address or Hostname:

		For each hop, the traceroute command shows the IP address or the hostname of the device at that hop. In the example, 2409:4072:80d:5113::79 is the first hop, and 2404:6800:8135::1 is the final hop.
		When DNS resolution is enabled, some of these IP addresses may also resolve to a hostname.


	-Request Timed Out:

		A Request timed out message indicates that a router along the path did not respond to the traceroute probes within the given time period (default is 5 seconds).
		This can happen for many reasons, such as routers being configured to ignore traceroute requests, network congestion, or packet loss.
		These timeouts do not necessarily indicate a problem, as the packets can still reach the destination (as shown by later hops).


	- TTL (Time-to-Live):

		Traceroute works by sending packets with a small TTL value (starting at 1 and incrementing with each hop). Each time a packet reaches a router, the TTL is decremented by 1.
		If the TTL reaches zero, the router sends an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the sender, and the sender increases the TTL to try the next hop.
		The output shows the latency for each hop, but TTL isn't explicitly shown in the output.



The tracert command has various options that allow you to customize its behavior. Here are some common options:

-d: Skip DNS lookup for hostnames. This speeds up the traceroute because it does not resolve IP addresses to hostnames.
Example: tracert -d www.google.com

-h <max_hops>: Set a maximum number of hops for the trace. The default is 30, but you can adjust this if you want to limit the trace.
Example: tracert -h 10 www.google.com (limits the trace to 10 hops).

-w <timeout>: Set the timeout for each reply in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms (5 seconds). You can increase or decrease this value if you're experiencing delays.
Example: tracert -w 3000 www.google.com (sets the timeout to 3 seconds).

-4: Force IPv4 mode for traceroute. Use this if the destination address is an IPv4 address.
Example: tracert -4 www.google.com

-6: Force IPv6 mode for traceroute. Use this if the destination address is an IPv6 address (as in your example).
Example: tracert -6 www.google.com

-T: Use TCP packets instead of ICMP Echo Requests for traceroute. This can be useful if ICMP traffic is being blocked by routers along the path.
Example: tracert -T www.google.com

-I: Use ICMP Echo Requests (default behavior). This is the usual mode for traceroute.
Example: tracert -I www.google.com

-R: Tracert in reverse (Reverse DNS lookup mode). This will resolve the IP addresses in reverse order (from destination to source).
Example: tracert -R www.google.com
