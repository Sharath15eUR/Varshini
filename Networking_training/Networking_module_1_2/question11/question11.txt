Using a terminal, connect to a remote machine via SSH and telnet

a) SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH is a secure way to access and manage a remote machine over a network. To connect to a remote machine via SSH:

	-Open the terminal on your Ubuntu machine.
      	-Use the SSH command:
		ssh username@<hostname_or_ip_address>

		Eg: varshini@198.168.1.100

    	-Password prompt:
        	After executing the command, you'll be prompted to enter the password for the remote user account.
        	Once authenticated, you will be logged into the remote machine's terminal.

    	-Exit SSH session:
        	To exit the SSH session, simply type exit and press Enter.

b) Telnet

Telnet is an older, less secure protocol used to access remote machines, but itâ€™s still sometimes used in specific cases for legacy systems.

	-Open the terminal on your Ubuntu machine.
      	-Use the Telnet command:
		telnet hostname_or_ip_address

		Eg: telnet 192.168.1.100

    	-Login:
        	Telnet will attempt to connect to the specified machine. You will be prompted to enter your username and password.

    	-Exit Telnet session:
        	To exit the Telnet session, type exit and then type quit.
