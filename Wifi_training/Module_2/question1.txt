### Brief about SplitMAC architecture and how it improves the AP's performance ###



- Split MAC Architecture:

In Split MAC architecture, the MAC layer functions of a wireless network are divided between the Access Point (AP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).


- The AP handles time-sensitive tasks, like:
	1. Sending beacons
	2. Acknowledging frames
	3. Handling encryption/decryption

- The WLC handles complex tasks, like:
	1.User authentication
	2.Roaming decisions
	3.QoS policies
	4. Access control

- How it improves AP performance:
	1.Simplifies AP design, reducing cost and complexity.
	2.Centralizes control, making the network easier to manage.
	3.Improves scalability and security, as policies are enforced consistently from the WLC.
