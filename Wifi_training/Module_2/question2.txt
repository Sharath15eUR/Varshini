- CAPWAP: Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points

CAPWAP is a standardized protocol that enables communication between a Lightweight AP and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). It allows central management, provisioning, and control of APs in a wireless network.



Flow Between AP and Controller (Step-by-Step)

1. AP Boot-Up

	-The AP powers on and performs a basic self-check.
	-It tries to discover a WLC using various methods like:
		-DHCP Option 43
		-DNS resolution
	-Broadcast or statically configured controller IP



2. Discovery Phase

	-The AP sends a CAPWAP Discovery Request.
	-One or more WLCs respond with Discovery Response messages.



3. Join Phase

	-The AP selects the best WLC based on response time, priority, etc.
	-Sends a Join Request to that WLC.
	-WLC authenticates and approves the AP with a Join Response.



4. Image and Configuration Download

	-If needed, the WLC upgrades the AP's image to match its own software version.
	-The WLC then pushes the AP configuration (SSID, VLANs, security settings, etc.).



5. Tunnel Establishment

	-Control Tunnel : For management/configuration traffic.
	-Data Tunnel : For user traffic.



6. Operational Phase
	-AP starts broadcasting SSIDs.
	-Wireless clients associate with AP.

All client data and management traffic goes through WLC via CAPWAP tunnels.
