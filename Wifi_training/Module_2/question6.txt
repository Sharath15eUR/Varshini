### What's the difference between Sniffer and monitor mode, use case for each mode ###



Sniffer Mode:

	-Purpose: Capture all traffic on the channel for analysis.
	-Traffic Handling: Does not interact with the network; only captures packets.
	-Traffic Visibility: Captures every packet on the channel.
	-Usage: Troubleshooting, security analysis, performance diagnostics.
	-Network Participation: Completely passive; does not participate in the network.
	-Tools Used: Wireshark, similar packet analyzers.


Monitor Mode:

	-Purpose: Passive monitoring of the network environment and interference detection.
	-Traffic Handling: Does not transmit user data but listens to the network for monitoring.
	-Traffic Visibility: Captures management frames, control frames, and data frames relevant to network health.
	-Usage: Network health monitoring, interference detection, channel planning.
	-Network Participation: Passive but still capable of analyzing the RF environment and network behavior.
	-Tools Used: Wireless diagnostic tools, Spectrum analyzers for RF environment analysis.
