### How the CAPWAP tunnel is maintained between AP and controller ###


-Tunnel Establishment: During initial join, control and data tunnels are created.
-Tunnel Maintenance: Heartbeat messages, rejoin attempts, and status updates ensure the tunnel stays active.
-Data Traffic Handling: User data is securely encapsulated and transmitted over the data tunnel.
-Failover and Reconnect: In case of disruptions, the AP attempts to re-establish the tunnel.
-Security: Both tunnels are typically encrypted to ensure data security.

This mechanism ensures that the AP and WLC remain in sync, providing centralized control and efficient data management in large-scale wireless networks.
