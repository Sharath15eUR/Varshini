### Discuss the benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 for IoT devices. ###


-TARGET WAKE TIME (TWT):
	TWT is a feature that schedules when devices should wake up and communicate with the router, allowing IoT devices to stay in sleep mode for longer periods.

-BENEFITS:
	-Power Efficiency: By scheduling wake times, IoT devices donâ€™t need to constantly stay connected to the network, leading to better battery life and reduced power consumption.

	-Improved Network Efficiency: It helps to reduce network congestion because IoT devices communicate only at predefined times, ensuring the network is less cluttered.
