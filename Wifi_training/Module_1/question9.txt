### List down the type of Wi-Fi internet connectivity backhaul, share your home/college's wireless internet connectivity backhaul name and its properties ###

Types of Wi-Fi Internet Connectivity Backhaul:


-Wired Backhaul:
	- Involves connecting the access point (AP) or router to the internet via Ethernet cables.
	- Provides high reliability, speed, and minimal latency.
	- Often used in homes, offices, and data centers.


-Wireless Backhaul:
	- Used when Ethernet wiring is impractical or impossible to install.
	- Wi-Fi mesh systems typically use wireless backhaul to connect multiple mesh nodes.
	- Can have some signal degradation and latency compared to wired backhaul, especially in congested areas.


-Fiber Optic Backhaul:
	- High-speed, long-distance connectivity using fiber optic cables.
	- Provides extremely high bandwidth, ideal for large-scale networks, especially for ISPs.
	- Often used in enterprise and ISP networks.


-Microwave Backhaul:
	-Wireless backhaul using microwave signals for long-distance connectivity.
	-Typically used for connecting remote or hard-to-reach areas to the main network.
	-Common in rural or isolated areas where laying cables is impractical or too expensive.


-Satellite Backhaul:
	-Uses satellite links to connect remote areas to the internet.
	-Typically slower and more expensive than fiber optic or wired backhaul, but useful for regions with no ground infrastructure.
	-Often used in rural or remote areas.



- Home network and backhaul properties:

	-Backhaul type: Wireless (Cellular Data-4G)
	-Provider: Airtel
	-Connection Speed: 10-100 Mbps (4G)
	-Latency: 30ms to 100ms (4G)
	-Reliability: Less reliable than wired connection.
