### What is the role of Guard Intervals in WLAN transmission? How does a short Guard Interval improve efficiency? ###

-Role of Guard Intervals in WLAN Transmission:

	Guard Intervals are short periods of time inserted between data symbols in OFDM transmissions to prevent interference from multipath reflections.


-Short Guard Interval (SGI): 
	-Reduces the time between symbols, allowing for faster data transmission. 
	-SGI improves efficiency but may increase the risk of data collisions in environments with severe multipath interference. 
	-In Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), SGI is typically set at 400 ns, compared to the longer 800 ns used in earlier standards.
