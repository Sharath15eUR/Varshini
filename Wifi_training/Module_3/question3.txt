### How do modulation schemes work in the PHY layer? Compare different modulation schemes and their performance across various Wi-Fi standards. ###


Modulation schemes define how the data is encoded onto the carrier signal. In the PHY layer, modulation determines how binary data is mapped onto the signal's properties.


Modulation Schemes in Wi-Fi:

-BPSK: 
	-Binary Phase Shift Keying
	-Simple modulation that shifts the phase of the signal to represent binary data.


-QPSK: 
	-Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
	-Carries 2 bits per symbol by shifting the phase in 4 distinct states.


-16-QAM: 
	-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
	-Transmits 4 bits per symbol by combining amplitude and phase changes.


-64-QAM: 
	-Transmits 6 bits per symbol by increasing the number of possible states in both amplitude and phase.


Comparison Across Standards:

802.11a/b/g: Typically use BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM for lower data rates, with 64-QAM available in higher-rate modes.

802.11n/ac/ax: Use higher-order QAM schemes like 64-QAM and 256-QAM to achieve faster data rates.
