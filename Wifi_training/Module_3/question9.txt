### What is the difference between MIMO and MU-MIMO? ###


-MIMO: 
	-Multiple Input, Multiple Output
	-It refers to the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends. 
	-It enhances the link by sending multiple data streams over the same frequency channel.



-MU-MIMO: 
	-Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output
	-A more advanced form of MIMO that allows a router to serve multiple devices at the same time on the same channel.
	-Helps in improving overall network capacity and reducing congestion.
