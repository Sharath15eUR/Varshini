### What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work? ###


DSSS:
	-Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum 
	-It works by spreading the data signal over a wider frequency band than the minimum bandwidth necessary. 
	-It uses a "spreading code" to multiply the data signal, which results in a higher transmission bandwidth.
	-Provides better resistance to interference and jamming. 
	-It is mainly used in 802.11b.

FHSS: 
	-Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
	-FHSS works by rapidly switching frequencies in a pseudorandom pattern. 
	-This allows devices to communicate while hopping over a set of frequencies.
	-Reduces the chance of interference since each transmission occurs on a different frequency.
