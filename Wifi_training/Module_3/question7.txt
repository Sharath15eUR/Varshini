### Describe the structure of an 802.11 PHY layer frame. What are its key components? ###

Structure of an 802.11 PHY Layer Frame:

PREAMBLE | HEADER | PSDU
   |	      |
   |	      |
   |	      |
   |       SIGNAL | SERVICE | LEN | crc
   |
SYNC | SFD



An 802.11 PHY frame is typically made up of several components:

-Preamble: 
	-Used for synchronization and includes both a short and long preamble for synchronization and data detection.
	-Sync(128/56 bits): Helps receiver to lock onto signal.
	-Start Frame Delimiter(16 bits): Marks the start of the frame.

-Header: 
	-Contains information such as the transmission length, destination, and source MAC address.
	-Signal(8 bits): Indicates data rate.
	-Service(8 bits): Reserved bits for future use
	-Length(8 bits):Specifies frame length.
	-CRC(8 bits): Error detection code for ensuring the integrity of the data.


-Data Payload: 
	-The actual data being transmitted.
