### What are PPDU, PLCP, and PMD in the PHY layer? ###


PPDU: 
	-Physical Protocol Data Unit
	-The entire PHY frame that includes the preamble, header, payload, and CRC.


PLCP: 
	-Physical Layer Convergence Protocol
	-Encapsulates the MAC (Medium Access Control) frame into a form suitable for transmission. 
	-It adds the PLCP header to the PPDU.


PMD: 
	-Physical Medium Dependent
	-The actual physical transmission of the data. 
	-It defines the modulation and encoding schemes used to transmit the data across the medium.
