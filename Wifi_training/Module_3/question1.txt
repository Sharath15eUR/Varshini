### What are the different 802.11 PHY layer standards? Compare their characteristics.  ###


The IEEE 802.11 standards define different Physical Layer (PHY) types for wireless communication. 

802.11a: 
	-5 GHz band
	-Data rate of 54 Mbps
	-OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing)
	-High-speed, short-range communication in environments with less interference.


802.11b: 
	-2.4 GHz band
	-Data rate of up to 11 Mbps
	-DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
	-It is more susceptible to interference from other devices operating in the same frequency band.


802.11g: 
	-2.4 GHz band
	-Data rate of 54 Mbps
	-Combining the best features of 802.11b (range) and 802.11a (speed) by using OFDM.


802.11n(Wi-Fi 4): 
	-2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands 
	-Data rates from 72 Mbps to 600 Mbps
	-MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)
	-Supports wider channels (up to 40 MHz) for better performance.


802.11ac(Wi-Fi 5): 
	-5 GHz band
	-supporting speeds up to 3.47 Gbps using wider channels (80 MHz and 160 MHz)
	-MIMO, OFDMA.


802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6): 
	-2.4 GHz,5 GHz and 6GHz bands 
	-Data rates up to 9.6 Gbps
	-OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), MU-MIMO and BSS Coloring.
