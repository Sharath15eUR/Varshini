### What is the significance of OFDM in WLAN? How does it improve performance? ###


OFDM:
	-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
	-It is a key technique used in modern Wi-Fi standards (such as 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax). 
	-It divides a channel into many smaller sub-channels, each carrying a part of the data, allowing simultaneous transmission.


Benefits:
	-Improved performance in multipath environments: OFDM is highly resistant to interference and multipath distortion.
	-Higher data rates: By using multiple sub-carriers, OFDM can transmit more data in the same bandwidth.
	-Efficient use of spectrum: By making the sub-carriers orthogonal, OFDM minimizes the overlap between them, leading to higher spectral efficiency.
