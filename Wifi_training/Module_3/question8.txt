### What is the difference between OFDM and OFDMA? ###


OFDM:
	-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
	-It divides a channel into multiple sub-channels and transmits data in parallel. 
	-It works well for scenarios where the receiver can handle multiple streams.



OFDMA:
	-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
	-It is an extension of OFDM used in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). 
	-It allows the allocation of sub-carriers to multiple users simultaneously, improving efficiency and throughput in crowded networks.
