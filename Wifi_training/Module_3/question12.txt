### How is the data rate calculated? ###


The data rate is determined by the following factors:

	-Channel Bandwidth: Wider channels allow more data.
	-Modulation Scheme: Higher-order modulation allows more bits per symbol.
	-MIMO and MU-MIMO: More spatial streams increase the throughput.
	-Coding Rate: The ratio of the number of data bits to total bits.


Data Rate: The speed at which data is transferred over a network.

	Data rate = No. of SD * No. of BPSCS * R * No. of SS / Time of DFT + Time of GI

	where
		No. of SD -> number of data subcarriers
		No. of BPSCS -> number of coded bits per subcarrier per stream
		R -> coding rate
		No. of SS -> number of spatial streams
		Time of DFT -> OFDM symbol duration
		Time of GI -> guard interval duration
