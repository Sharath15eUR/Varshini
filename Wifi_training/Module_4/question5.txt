###  Brief about the client association process ###


-The client association process is the sequence of steps a device follows to connect to an AP in a wireless network:

	-Scan for available networks by scanning.
	-Select an AP to join.
	-Authentication: The client sends an authentication request to the AP, which responds with an authentication success message (using an open system or shared key).
	-Association: The client sends an association request to the AP, which includes information such as supported data rates and capabilities. The AP responds with an association response.

Once associated, the client can exchange data with the AP and other devices on the network.
