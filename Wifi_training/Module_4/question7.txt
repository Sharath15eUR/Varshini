### Describe the power saving scheme in MAC layer and explore on the types of Power saving mechanisms ###



-Power-saving schemes are critical for battery-powered devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices.

	-PS (Power Save) Mode: In PS mode, the client device periodically "sleeps" and only wakes up to check if thereâ€™s any buffered data waiting for it. This helps to conserve battery.

	-DTIM (Delivery Traffic Indication Map): The AP periodically sends a DTIM to notify clients about buffered data. Devices that are in power-save mode wake up during these intervals to receive data.

	-U-APSD (Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery): An enhancement that allows devices to save power by dynamically adjusting their wake-up periods, unlike traditional PS mode.



-Types of Power-saving Mechanisms:

	-Legacy Power Save: Devices go to sleep during idle periods and check at scheduled intervals.

Fast Power Save: More modern systems allow for more dynamic, real-time adjustments to sleep/wake schedules.
