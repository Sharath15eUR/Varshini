### Describe the Medium Access Control methodologies ###


-CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance): The primary method in Wi-Fi networks that reduces collisions by sensing the medium and using backoff periods.

-RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send): Used to avoid collisions in hidden node scenarios by using a handshake before data transmission.

-TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access): Allocates fixed time slots to each device for transmission.

-OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access): Introduced in Wi-Fi 6 to divide channels into smaller subcarriers for simultaneous transmission by multiple devices.

-Polling: The AP controls communication, polling each device to ask if it has data to send, preventing collisions.

-CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access): Uses unique codes to differentiate between transmissions from multiple devices over the same frequency, used mainly in cellular networks.
