### Brief about the Block ACK mechanism and its advantages ###



-BLOCK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

	-The Block ACK mechanism allows multiple data frames to be acknowledged with a single acknowledgment frame. This reduces overhead by eliminating the need for individual ACK frames for each transmitted data frame.



-ADVANTAGES:

	-Reduced Overhead: By acknowledging a group of frames, the total number of acknowledgment frames decreases.

	-Higher Efficiency: Multiple frames can be transmitted in one burst with a single acknowledgment, improving throughput.

	-Better Utilization: Especially useful in high-throughput or bulk data transfer scenarios.
