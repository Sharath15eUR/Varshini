### What is the significance of MAC layer and in which position it is placed in the OSI model ###


- MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL(MAC):

	-The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model.
	-It controls access to the shared communication medium. 
	-It determines how devices on a network access and share the physical transmission medium.
	-Collision avoidance: Preventing simultaneous transmission from multiple devices.
	-Frame sequencing and addressing: Ensuring frames are delivered correctly to the correct device.
	-Medium access control: Managing how devices access the shared communication medium.

- POSITION:
	-The MAC layer operates between the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and the Network Layer (Layer 3).
