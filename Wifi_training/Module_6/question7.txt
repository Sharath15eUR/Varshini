### How does the 4-way handshake ensure mutual authentication between the client and the access point?  ###



The 4-way handshake ensures mutual authentication by proving that both the client and the access point possess the same PMK without ever transmitting it:

	-The access point sends a random number (ANonce) to the client.

	-The client generates its own random number (SNonce) and calculates the PTK using the PMK, ANonce, SNonce, and MAC addresses.

	-The client sends the SNonce and a Message Integrity Code (MIC) back to the AP.

	-The AP performs the same calculations. If the MIC is valid, it confirms both sides have the same PMK.



This exchange ensures:

	-The client can verify the APâ€™s legitimacy.
	-The AP can verify the client has the correct PMK.
	-A unique encryption key is derived for that session.
	-Thus, mutual authentication and key agreement are securely achieved.
