### How does 802.1X enhance security over wireless networks? ###



-802.1X enhances wireless security by integrating authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) into Wi-Fi connections. 

It provides the following advantages:

	-Uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods to support secure authentication using passwords, certificates, smart cards, or other credentials.

	-Enables individualized session keys for each user, preventing eavesdropping between clients on the same network.

	-Supports dynamic VLAN assignment and role-based access control, tailoring network access based on user identity.

	-Works with WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise modes to provide strong mutual authentication between the client and the authentication server via the access point.

	-This results in a scalable, robust, and secure solution for managing access to enterprise wireless networks.
